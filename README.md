schoenberg: Tools for 12-Tone Musical Composition
======================================

## Overview
The `schoenberg` package offers functions for creating and manipulating 12-tone (i.e., dodecaphonic) musical matrices using Arnold Schoenberg's (1923) serialism technique. This package can generate random 12-tone matrices and can generate matrices using a pre-determined sequence of notes.
